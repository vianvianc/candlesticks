          This project will be an attempt at a professional candlestick trading information homepage.
          The webpage/homepage will detail the history of candlesticks, how they are presented to traders today and
          will detail a select few indicators. I want to focus on front-end
          development and to integrate as many bootstrap elements as I have content for,
          including a form, navbar to future links, content on accordian, and background
          and carosel images.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 border border-2 border-primary bg-info">
          The audience will range from younger day traders often looking for trends on reddit forums
          to mid-level traders who want to save time and explore new ways to implement their trading strategy
          or find additional confirmation signals to their existing trading plan. The page will also
          serve to showcase my front-end experience to potential employers.

        <div class="col-md-4 border border-2 border-primary bg-success">
          My goal is to put some candlestick content online and have a fully functioning homepage
          and contact form with links to other pages in progress. This is my personal future project where I
          hope to integrate a financial API where I can analyze historical financial data to validate the
          candlesticks status as an accurate price predictor. Then I would like to see which indicators are the most
          accurate and create a real-time candlestick pattern tool which searches for the pattern the day/hour/minute
          it occurs. I want to include tags for search engine optimization and optimize the site across all devices/
          browsers. I want to get an internship/job, attract freelance clients, and have project to showcase during an interview.
