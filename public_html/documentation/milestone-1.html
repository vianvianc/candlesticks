          This project will be an attempt at a professional retail website homepage.
          The website will specialize in van conversions. I want to focus on front-end
          development and to integrate as many bootstrap elements as I have content for,
          including a form, navbar to future links, content on accordian, and background
          and carosel images.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 border border-2 border-primary bg-info">
          The audience will be outdoorsy, middle-class, consumers considering hiring a
          professional to convert their existing or new van for leisure travel. It would
          be designed for clients and to showcase my front-end experience to potential employers.

          My goal is to put some van-build content online and have a fully functioning homepage
          and contact form with links to other pages in progress. I want to include tags for search engine
          optimization and optimize the site across all devices/browsers. I want to get an internship/job,
          attract freelance clients, and have project to showcase during an interview.
