            <p>In feudal Japan, 1603, rice was collected as tax in different domains and transported to Osaka .
                Around 1629, a wealthy merchant named Yodoya started a rice market to trade tax rice with rice bills.
                The Dojima Rice Exchange in 1697 was the world's first futures market. Trading was held on the
                roads around the exchange and after the markets closed, water was thrown to disperse lingering crowds.
                The price of rice would be telegraphed with flag signals to reach the capital.</p>

            <p> Most historians agree that Homma Munehisa around 1750
                began the futures market concept, by handing out rice bale promisary notes. Homma drew
                bar charts on time intervals (previously unheard of), came up with trading strategies,
                identified   reversal patterns. He is the father of candlestick charting. Here is
                a painting of Homma on his blanket with his concubines.</p>

            <p>In 1989, researcher and trader, Steve Nison published his best-selling famous book "Japanese
            Candlestick Charting Techniques". This revolutionized the markets. He defined 'price action'
            and laid the basis for modern trading strategies. Now, nowhere in the world is a chart represented
            without candlesticks and all traders, big and small, have some understanding of candlesticks. </p>
