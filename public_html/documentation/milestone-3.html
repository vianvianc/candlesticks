            <p>In feudal Japan, rice was collected as tax in the different regions. Gradually rice markets sprang up
                to trade tax-rice with rice bills. The Dojima Rice Exchange in 1697 was the world's first futures market with rice
                essentially being a currency, a necessary payment to the Tokugawa Shogunate.
                Trading was held on the roads around the exchange and after the markets closed, water was thrown to disperse
                lingering crowds. The price of rice would be telegraphed with flag signals to reach the capital.</p>

            <p> A wealthy merchant named Homma Munehisa around 1750 began the futures market concept, by mass-distributing rice bale
                promissory notes. Homma drew bar charts on time intervals (previously unheard of), came up with trading strategies,
                identified reversal patterns. He is the father of candlestick charting. Homma saw that market sentiment (fear and greed)
                was reflected in the price and could be visualized in patterns. Here is a painting of Homma on his blanket with his concubines.</p>

            <p>In 1989, researcher and trader, Steve Nison published his best-selling book "Japanese
                Candlestick Charting Techniques". This book completely revolutionized the markets. He introduced Hommas
                'price action' which is a psychological study of sentiment.  Up until then, traders based reversals and continuations on moving averages
                and other statistical equations. Now, nowhere in the world is a chart represented without candlesticks and all traders, big and small,
                have some understanding of candlesticks. </p>

            <p>Anyone who has tried to study candlesticks patterns has likely been overwhelmed by the sheer number of
                indicators. Here is a non-comprehensive list of just the reversal patterns. It would take 1000s of hours of
                disciplined monitoring of markets to identify these patterns. And when you want to stop sitting on the sidelines
                it's easy to imagine you're seeing a pattern that isn't there. It's obvious that it's too much data to process,
                especially if you want to trade high-volume or be in positions for minutes. While every trading platform displays
                their charts in candlesticks as a default, none of them offer any candlestick indicator alerts. </p>
