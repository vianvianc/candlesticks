            <p>In feudal Japan, 1603, rice was collected as tax in different domains and transported to osaka .
                Around 1629 a wealthy merchant named Yodoya started a rice market to trade tax rice with rice bills.
                The Dojima Rice Exchange in 1697 was the worlds first futures market. Trading
            was held on the roads around the exchange and after the markets closed water was thrown to disperse lingering crowds. </p>

            <p> Most historians agree that Homma Munehisa around 1750
            began the futures market concept, by handing out rice bale promises. Homma drew
            bar charts on time intervals, previously unheard of, and invented candlestick charting.
            Here is a painting of Homma on his blanket with his concubines.</p>
